# Using the default BaseQuery directory
# Usage: ./query.sh test@example.com 
# Usage: ./query.sh test@

# Usage: ./query.sh /home/user/Desktop/file.txt

# Using an external BaseQuery directory
# Usage: ./query.sh test@example.com /home/user/Desktop/data
# Usage: ./query.sh test@ /home/user/Desktop/data

# Description:	First query.sh checks to make sure that the user is in the correct
#		directory. Checks to see if the query is a file or is a email address
#		calls the search.sh script with the correct params. The user is able 
#		to use this script in a few different ways. You can search for a specific 
#		email address, a username of an email address, any username for a specific 
#		domain name, or pass a path to a file to automate the past three options. 
#		If a external data/ directory is given as a second parameter the data will be
#		queried there instead of the normal ./data/ directory inside BaseQuery.
